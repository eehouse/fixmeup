<H1> <EM>FixMeUp!</EM> and Fixed Innovations Credits</H1>

<p>
<EM>FixMeUp!</EM>, the Fixed Innovations axle, and this website
have happened because of the efforts, energy, and friendship of
dozens of people in the bicycle industry and in recreational
and transportational cycling.  In the interest of brevity, only
a few are called out here.
</p>

<HR>

<P><A HREF="http://www.best.com/~hkingman/">Henry Kingman</A> politely
pointed out that the old site needed a facelift and then leant his
web-design expertise to the effort.  He's responsible for the navigation
bars and nice short pages.  If this site reads as if it's known
a professional editor, you're looking at Henry's work.</P>

<P><A HREF="mailto:vswart@sirius.com">Victoria Swart</A>, graphic
artist extraordinaire, designed the spinning cog image that is now
Fixed Innovations' official logo.  (Letterhead stationery coming
soon.)</P>

<P>Grant Petersen, while at Bridgestone, gave me the RB-1 that got me
hooked on fixed gear riding and whose vertical dropouts first posed 
<EM>the problem</EM>.</P>

<P>Pardo provided the mental leap that made <EM>FixMeUp!</EM>
possible.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/">Sheldon Brown</A> created
the cog that became our background image, and gave feedback that helped
shape the early design of 
<A HREF="{{ url_for('fixin.downloads', _anchor='mac')}}"><EM>FixMeUp!</EM> for Macintosh</A>.</P>

<P>Peter Enright of <A HREF="http://www.philwood.com/">Phil Wood and Co.</A> 
arranged and paid for the professional photographs that will soon grace our
<A HREF="{{url_for('fixin.products')}}">products</A> page -- including
those of his competitors' hubs.</P>

<p><a href="http://www.phred.org/~josh/">Joshua Putnam</a>, <a
href="http://www.milehighskates.com">Mark Chandler</a>, and John
Bayley, fellow bike-tech nuts, helped in the design of the <a
href="{{ url_for('fixin.axle') }}">Fixed Innovations axle</a>.</p>

<P>Ariela picked the color scheme for <A HREF="{{
 url_for('fixin.javafmu') }}">Java <EM>FixMeUp!</EM></A>  -- which
 then migrated to this site.</P>

<P>We adapted the chain image for the navigation bar from 
Pete Gray&#39;s Bicycle Chain Applet.</P>

<p>Bennett Marks helped with the math that makes <em>FixMeUp!</em>
go.</p>

<p>
    <a href="mailto:fixin@eehouse.org">Eric House</a> wrote all the Java,
    C, perl, php (never again!), and flask/python code in the various versions of
    <EM>FixMeUp!</EM>, and most of the site you're suffering through
    here.  He was working on OpenDoc
    at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Apple</A> when this site was
    first created, and since then has worked at Sun/JavaSoft, AvantGo,
    Good Technologies, Palm, HP, Big Fish Games and Open Garden.
    Ariela and Brynn call him &quot;Dad.&quot; Or worse.
