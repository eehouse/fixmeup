<h3>Source code to <EM>FixMeUp!</EM> and the Fixed Innovations web site</h3>

<p>
This web site and most of the code and text it contains are created
and maintained on (free) GNU/Linux systems.  Since I've enjoyed
learning from the work of others freely shared, I'll be providing the
Flask/python source code to this web site (once it's done).  Comments
are sparse, but I hope they'll be of use to someone.
