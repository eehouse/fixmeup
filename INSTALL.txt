Ok, so you've successfully checked out FixMeUp from github. This
document describes how to get it working locally, and then how to
configure a Linux server to host it on the web.

Note that this directory lives in /home/prod/flask-apps on my
machines. You may need to change paths in the instructions below and
even in included files (e.g. fixmeup.service) if you have it somewhere
else.

Also note that I use Debian and Ubuntu. I have no idea if any of this
works on MacOS or WindowsAnything.

------------------------- Local configuration -------------------------

First, install the necessary system packages. This command will work
on Debian or derivatives like Ubuntu:

# sudo apt install python3-venv libpython3-dev

Now cd into the directory where this file (that you're reading now) is
located. Run the following three commands to create a python virtual
environment to host FixMeUp. (The same environment works for
development and for public consumption online.)

# python3 -m venv venv
# . ./venv/bin/activate
(venv) # pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can launch the development server:
(venv) # flask run

And point a browser (on the same machine you're using for this) at:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/fixin/

You should see the Home Page for FixMeUp! in your browser.

------------------------- Server configuration -------------------------

Complete server config is harder and more variable than I can promise
to explain here. My own config is set up to make it easy to add
multiple flask-based apps (like FixMeUp). Basically my config was
created by these three steps (IIRC):

1) Install nginx

# sudo apt install nginx

2) Install and run certbot, which will modify the nginx config to
include https support. (This may be optional if you don't care about
https. But I haven't tried setting up a server without it in longer
than I've been using flask.)

# sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
# sudo certbot -d <yourdomain.com>

3) Configure nginx to know about the fixin and fmu paths. In my case,
that was as simple as adding the following line at the end of the
default server config of nginx (/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default):

    include /home/prod/flask-apps/*/nginx.conf;

Finally, you need to tell systemd to run your server.

# (cd /etc/systemd/system && sudo ln -sf /home/prod/flask-apps/fixmeup/server_config/files/etc/systemd/system/fixmeup.service .)

Restart nginx and start fixmeup.service

# sudo systemctl restart nginx
# sudo systemctl start fixmeup.service

Now any browser in the world should see FixMeUp at https://yourdomain.com/fixin.

Finally, when all's working, and if you want FixMeUp to survive reboots

# sudo systemctl enable fixmeup.service
