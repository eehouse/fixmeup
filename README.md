Fixed-gear/single-speed calculator for bicycles

This project is the source for the website at https://eehouse.org/fixin.

It's an extremely specialized calculator that helps bicyclists with
frames with vertical dropouts figure out what gears (combinations of
chainring and cog) will allow them to run their frames as fixies or
single-speeds.

Did I mention it's specialized? But for those who need it it's proven
useful. It still brings a handful of visitors to my site every day,
and has been doing so for 30 years. It's been around for that long in
one form or another, always free to use, but this is the first time
I've published the source. Enjoy.
