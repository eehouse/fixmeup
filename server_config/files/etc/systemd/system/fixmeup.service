After=network.target

# tells the init system to only start this after the networking target
# has been reached We will give our regular user account ownership of
# the process since it owns all of the relevant files

[Service]
# Service specify the user and group under which our process will run.
User=prod

# give group ownership to the www-data group so that Nginx can
# communicate easily with the Gunicorn processes.
Group=www-data

# We'll then map out the working directory and set the PATH
# environmental variable so that the init system knows where our the
# executables for the process are located (within our virtual
# environment).

WorkingDirectory=/home/prod/flask-apps/fixmeup
Environment="PATH=/home/prod/flask-apps/fixmeup/venv/bin"

# We'll then specify the commanded to start the service
ExecStart=/home/prod/flask-apps/fixmeup/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:app.sock -m 007 wsgi:app

# This will tell systemd what to link this service to if we enable it
# to start at boot. We want this service to start when the regular
# multi-user system is up and running:
